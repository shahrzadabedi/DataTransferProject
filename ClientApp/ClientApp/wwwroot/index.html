    <b>Problem:</b>
    <br />Data Transit Library The purpose of this project is to create a library for a company to transfer their data efficiently without needing to have deep knowledge about different data sources and transfer channels.
    <br />This library will introduce API's and abstractions that developers can use to design and implement data transfer infrastructures. The client wants to start the first phase by reading bulk data, 500,000 records from a random generated excel file and adding to a Redis database, in the second phase the loaded data should import to a SQL database.
    this process should be multithreaded and of course as fast as possible.
    <br /><b>Explanation</b>
    <br />This three different parts of a DDD project have been put in three projects: ClientApp.Infrastructure, ClientApp.Domain and ClientApp.API.
    <br />Also the abstract logic to transfer data has been implemented in project DataTransferLib as an external library.
    <br />The Controller to test is 'TeamController' and there is a test json postman export file 'TeamCollection.postman_collection' located in 'Files' folder
